## Technologies

This project was developed using the following technologies:

- [Typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/)
- [React](https://reactjs.org)
- [NextJS](https://nextjs.org/)

## Next Level Week - Booster

Next Level Week is a micro bootcamp promoted by Rocketseat to teach fullstack development with Typescript, ReactJS and NextJS, in a hands-on experience, creating a fully functional web application. A single programming language to dominate the entire development cycle, using technologies seen in many large companies today.

In this edition of the event we developed move.it.

## Move.it

Move.it is a platform that presents the pomodoro technique. Pomodoro is a simple technique that increases productivity, the ability to manage time and control distractions. It is based on the idea that by dividing our workflow into blocks of intense concentration, we can improve brain agility and stimulate our focus. Move.it has a 25-minute chronometer, and after that it offers an exercise option worth xp, and with each accepted challenge, the participant progresses in level.


### Layout
